<h1> Will Smith's Fantastic House </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> Will Smith is a man of many roles. You may know him from being in The Pursuit of Happiness, Bad Boys,
  Men in Black, I am Legend, Hancock, Seven Pounds, Independence Day, and many others. <br>
  With his impressive resume, he has a lot of money to put into a house (naturally). His house holds up the reputation, that's for sure.
With nature inspired and African Influences throughout the house in many ways, his house is unique in its' own way and totally Will.  </p>

  <h2> Not Their Only Home </h2>
  <br>
  <p> What I found really interesting is that this is not the Smith's only home! It is the house where they spend 90% of their time. <br>
    They have many other homes spanning across the country. <p>
      <br>
      <br>
